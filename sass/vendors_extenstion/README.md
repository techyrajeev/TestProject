# Vendors Extension

If we have to override a section of any vendor, in `vendors-extensions/` we create files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite. For instance, `vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss` is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrapâ€™s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
